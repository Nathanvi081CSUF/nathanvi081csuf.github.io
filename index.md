### CPSC 120

* Lab 2, part 1

    This lab was about creating your own madlib game. This was a notable lab for me because it was one of the first type of game we would attempt in this course. I only heard of "madlib" but did not know what it really was so this was a nice introduction not only for an early lab but for the game in genral for me. Just typing random words and having it create the sentence I did enjoy as I saw the code compiled properly with no errors.

* Lab 7, part 1

    This Lab was one of my favorite labs from this semester. This lab was about creating a code to know when parking is allowed on certain streets. I did enjoy using having to use and implement compound boolean operators for the first time. It was very gratifying to see the code work as expected when everything was completed.

* Lab 9, part 1

    This Lab was another favorite for this semester for me because it was one of the first to implement the use of both ifstream and ofstream. I also liked the concept of saving a number which also could become a password with different conditions. And seeing the program work with the proper errors if the expected input was not there was assuring. It was nice to see the number that was saved and opened to for the game was very cool for me.
